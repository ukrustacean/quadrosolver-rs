# quadrosolver-rs
A small ðŸš€blazing fastðŸš€ and âš¡memory safeâš¡ CLI program for solving
quadratic equations, written with Rust. (Also my university assignment)

## Building and running

You will need Rust Programming language toolchain to run this program.
The easiest way to obtain one is using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
After you have `rustc` and `cargo` up and running, use the following
commands to clone, build and run the program:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ukrustacean/quadrosolver-rs.git
$ cd ./quadrosolver-rs

# To build
$ cargo build

# To run
$ cargo run

# To run and pass file.txt as argument
$ cargo run -- file.txt
```
